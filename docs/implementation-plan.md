## Technical Implementation Details

### DocumentManager GenServer
```elixir
defmodule Markdoc.Documents.DocumentManager do
  use GenServer
  
  @auto_save_interval 10_000
  
  def start_link(document_id) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, document_id, name: via_tuple(document_id))
  end
  
  def init(document_id) do
    content = Markdoc.Storage.FileStore.load_document(document_id)
    
    state = %{
      id: document_id,
      content: content,
      users: %{},
      version: 0,
      last_saved: DateTime.utc_now(),
      dirty: false
    }
    
    schedule_auto_save()
    {:ok, state}
  end
  
  # Handle text operations, user presence, auto-save, etc.
end
```

### Phoenix Channel Events
```elixir
defmodule MarkdocWeb.DocumentChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel
  
  def join("document:" <> document_id, %{"user_name" => name}, socket) do
    # Add user to document, assign color, broadcast presence
  end
  
  def handle_in("text_change", %{"operation" => op}, socket) do
    # Apply operation, transform conflicts, broadcast to others
  end
  
  def handle_in("cursor_move", %{"position" => pos}, socket) do
    # Update cursor position, broadcast to other users
  end
end
```

### Client-Side Cursor Tracking
```javascript
// assets/js/cursor_tracker.js
export class CursorTracker {
  constructor(editor, channel) {
    this.editor = editor;
    this.channel = channel;
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }
  
  setupEventListeners() {
    this.editor.addEventListener('selectionchange', () => {
      const selection = this.getSelection();
      this.channel.push('cursor_move', {
        position: selection.start,
        selection: selection.start !== selection.end ? selection : null
      });
    });
  }
  
  renderUserCursors(users) {
    // Create visual cursor overlays for each user
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **DocumentManager**: State management, operation handling
- **Operations**: Transform algorithm correctness  
- **FileStore**: File I/O operations and error handling
- **Channels**: WebSocket event handling

### Integration Tests
- **Multi-user scenarios**: Concurrent editing workflows
- **Real-time sync**: End-to-end operation broadcasting
- **Presence tracking**: User join/leave scenarios
- **File persistence**: Auto-save and recovery

### Performance Tests
- **Load testing**: 10+ concurrent users per document
- **Latency testing**: < 100ms operation response times
- **Memory usage**: Document state management efficiency
- **File I/O**: Save operation performance

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Setup
```elixir
# config/prod.exs
config :markdoc, Markdoc.Documents,
  storage_path: System.get_env("DOCS_STORAGE_PATH") || "/app/docs",
  auto_save_interval: String.to_integer(System.get_env("AUTO_SAVE_INTERVAL") || "10000")

config :markdoc, MarkdocWeb.Endpoint,
  secret_key_base: System.fetch_env!("SECRET_KEY_BASE"),
  url: [host: System.get_env("HOST"), port: 443, scheme: "https"]
```
